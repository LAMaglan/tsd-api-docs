# Overview

For questions about integration please contact: `tsd-drift@usit.uio.no`.

### Production environment

The production API is available at `https://api.tsd.usit.no`. TSD has a test project named `p11` against which apps can be developed. Note that this project is not intended to store sensitive data of any kind.

### Network access restrictions

The API is not available from all networks, due to current security policy. TSD has approval to open up for access to all Norwegian educational networks (uninett) upon request. If you plan to use the API from a network outside of the former scope, please contact us, so we can arrange access.
